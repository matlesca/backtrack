                Backtrack lets you browse through a timeline of public events - or personal events using Facebook photo albums - and find out which music you listened to at that time.

            <span class="about-text medium">Why Backtrack</span>
            <p class="about-text small">
                I live in Paris. During the terrorist attacks of November 13th, I kept listening to The Pains of Being Pure At Heart. A few weeks afterwards, when I heard their music again, I instantly got in the same mood : anxiety, discomfort, sadness. My brain had deeply associated these feelings to the band.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text small">
                However when I browsed backwards to my summer vacations in Britanny, it wasn't the same story : The Avalanches felt like freedom, family time, late picnics on the beach.
